/* 
@title Formal Verification for Integer Overflow Detection
@notice This contract demonstrates a potential integer overflow scenario and checks for initialization before accepting any input.
@dev The contract utilizes basic conditional checks to identify overflow situations.

Objectives: 
(a) Initialize the contract once before processing any input.
(b) Emit logs for different states of the contract: initialization, safe state, and overflow state.
(c) Check for potential integer overflow when processing input.

Solution:
To exploit the overflow vulnerability, one can input the maximum value of the int data type. 
On adding 1, it will wrap around and cause an overflow. 

Explanation:
Integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that's outside the range of the data type. 
In this case, the vulnerability is due to the unchecked addition of the inputValue. 
If the inputValue is the maximum possible value for an int, adding 1 will cause it to overflow.

Formal Verification:
Formal verification can be utilized to analyze the contract's code mathematically to prove the correctness of the logic and detect vulnerabilities like integer overflow. 
Tools like Manticore can be used to perform this analysis and determine the overflow vulnerability in this contract.
